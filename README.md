#Here's a summary of the key characteristics of a sticky header:

* Remains fixed at the top of the viewport while the user scrolls.
* Usually contains a website logo, navigation menu, and sometimes other important elements.
* Provides a consistent user experience and easy access to navigation options.
* Implemented using CSS (e.g., position: fixed) and JavaScript to manage its behavior.


```css
.sticky {
  background-color: #fff; /* Change the background color when sticky */
  position: fixed; /* Stick the header at the top */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Add a box shadow when sticky */
  /* Add any other styles you want to apply when the header is sticky */
}
```
This class can be added to styles
